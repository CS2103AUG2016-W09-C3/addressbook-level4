### Editing a task: `edit`
You will never know when things might change. Life is unpredictable. ToDoIt knows this, and lets you adapt to the erratic changes you may have in your schedule. Modify your tasks with a simple command.<br>
Format: `edit INDEX [n/TASK_NAME] [d/DATE_TIME] [l/LENGTH] [r/RECUR] [p/PRIORITY] [i/INFORMATION] [t/TAG]...` 

**Options**
> 1. `n/` Name: Edits the name of the task.
> 2. `d/` Date and time: Edits the start date and time of a task. Please refer to the Date Specifications section for what formats are accepted.

### Rescheduling a task: `reschedule`
ToDoIt does not expect you to be the perfect worker. When you do not feel up to the task right now, simply reschedule it to another time.<br>
Format: `reschedule INDEX INTERVAL` 

**Notes**
> * This reschedules the task at the specified `INDEX`.  <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ... <br>
> * For interval, use a number followed by a time interval (`m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, for minutes, hours, days, weeks respectively), e.g. `6d`, `1w`. You may also use `hr`, `hrs`, `day`, `days`, `week` and `weeks` for their respective interval.
> * Negative numbers are not supported. To reschedule to an earlier time, consider using `edit` instead.
 
**Example**
> * You need to get some homework done, but you just got back from school and you need a break. Simply find your homework task, then run the following command: <br>
>   `find homework`<br> 
    `reschedule 1 1h`

```
