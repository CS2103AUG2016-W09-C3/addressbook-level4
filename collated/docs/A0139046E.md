### Editing a task: `edit`
You never know when things change. Life is unpredictable. ToDoIt knows this, and allows you to adapt to the erratic changes you may have in your schedule. Modify your tasks with a simple command.<br>
Format: `edit INDEX [n/TASK_NAME] [d/DATE_TIME] [l/LENGTH] [r/RECUR] [p/PRIORITY] [i/INFORMATION] [t/TAG]...` 

**Options**
> 1. `n/` Name: The new name of the task.
> 1. `d/` Date and time: Specifies the start date and time of a task. Please refer to the Date Specifications section for what formats are accepted.
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
> 5. `a/` Autoschedule: If flag is specified, the task will be automatically scheduled to a free slot. If a time, date and length is specified, this flag is ignored.
> 6. `i/` Information: Information to be tagged to this task. Put any extra details you want here.
> 7. `t/` Tags: Specifies tags that are tagged to this task. Tags allow you to group tasks logically by assigning them a similar tag.

**Notes**
> * This edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ... <br>
> * Replaces the current task data with the specified task data.<br>
> * When editing a task's date and time, if only the date or the time is specified, then only the date or the time will be edited. For example, including `d/6th Oct` a task on 5th Oct 2pm will change the date to 6th Oct 2pm.<br>
> * For more information regarding the options, refer to `add` command.

**Example**
> * Your boss just changed the date of a meeting on the 3rd October to the 2nd. Simply find your meeting task, then run the following command: <br>
>   `find meeting`<br> 
    `edit 1 d/2nd Oct`

### Rescheduling a task: `reschedule`
ToDoIt does not expect you to be the perfect worker. Sometimes you are too busy or tired to do a task. If you are not feeling up to it right now, simply reschedule it for another day.<br>
Format: `reschedule INDEX INTERVAL` 

**Notes**
> * This reschedules the task at the specified `INDEX`.  <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ... <br>
> * For interval, use a number followed by a time interval (`m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, for minutes, hours, days, weeks respectively), e.g. `6d`, `1w`. You may also use `hr`, `hrs`, `day`, `days`, `week` and `weeks` for their respective interval.
> * Negative numbers are not supported. To reschedule to an earlier time, consider using `edit` instead.
 
**Example**
> * You need to get some homework done, but you just got back from school and you need a break. Simply find your homework task, then run the following command: <br>
>   `find homework`<br> 
    `reschedule 1 1h`

```
