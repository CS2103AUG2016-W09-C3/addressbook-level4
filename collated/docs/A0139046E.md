### Editing a task: `edit`
You will never know when things might change. Life is unpredictable. ToDoIt knows this, and lets you adapt to the erratic changes you may have in your schedule. Modify your tasks with a simple command.<br>
Format: `edit INDEX [n/TASK_NAME] [d/DATE_TIME] [l/LENGTH] [r/RECUR] [p/PRIORITY] [i/INFORMATION] [t/TAG]...` 

**Options**
> 1. `n/` Name: Edits the name of the task.
> 2. `d/` Date and time: Edits the start date and time of a task. Please refer to the Date Specifications section for what formats are accepted.
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
> 6. `i/` Information: Edits information of this task.
> 7. `t/` Tags: Edits tags that are tagged with the task.

**Notes**
> * This edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ... <br>
> * Replaces the current task data with the specified task data.<br>
> * When editing a task's date and time, if only the date or the time is specified, then only the date or the time will be edited. For example, including `d/6th Oct` a task on 5th Oct 2pm will change the date to 6th Oct 2pm.<br>
> * For more information regarding the options, refer to `add` command.

**Example**
> * Your boss just changed the date of a meeting on the 3rd October to the 2nd. Simply find your meeting task, then run the following command: <br>
>   `find meeting`<br> 
    `edit 1 d/2nd Oct`

### Rescheduling a task: `reschedule`
ToDoIt does not expect you to be the perfect worker. When you do not feel up to the task right now, simply reschedule it to another time.<br>
Format: `reschedule INDEX INTERVAL` 

**Notes**
> * This reschedules the task at the specified `INDEX`.  <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ... <br>
> * For interval, use a number followed by a time interval (`m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, for minutes, hours, days, weeks respectively), e.g. `6d`, `1w`. You may also use `hr`, `hrs`, `day`, `days`, `week` and `weeks` for their respective interval.
> * Negative numbers are not supported. To reschedule to an earlier time, consider using `edit` instead.
 
**Example**
> * You need to get some homework done, but you just got back from school and you need a break. Simply find your homework task, then run the following command: <br>
>   `find homework`<br> 
    `reschedule 1 1h`

```
