## Appendix E : Product Survey

Document product survey:

Product | Pros | Cons | Summary
-------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-----------
Google Calendar | 1. Integration with all of google's existing products including google now voice assistant<br><br>2. Shortcuts available from within gmail<br><br>3. Available on all platforms<br><br>4. Can sync calendar with other people<br><br>5. Notifications and reminders about tasks<br><br>6. Automatic addition of events from gmail<br><br> | 1. Needs to be accessed with browsers mainly or phone applications<br><br>2. Needs internet connection to keep updated<br><br>3. Not much support for tasks without a clear deadline or timing<br><br> | Google Calendar fits the requirements as if the user uses gmail, it would be a lot easier using the automatic addition feature in gmail. However, a web-based solution may not be the fastest to work with due to the lack of support for tasks.
Todo.txt | 1. Simple and fast<br><br>2. Able to set different priorities for task<br><br>3. Able to group task into a particular project so that we can see all tasks related to the project<br><br>4. Todo.txt supports dropbox, so the user can sync easily sync task between mobile on both Android and Apple phones with the computers | 1. No support for recurring task<br><br>2. Only for users that prefer command line input | Todo.txt will cater to users like Jim to a large extend. Todo.txt is perfect for Jim as it uses command line inputs, and ToDo.txt meets a lot of our requirements for our program so we can use this application as a gauge.
Wunderlist | 1. Aesthetically pleasing with a responsive interface<br><br>2. Self-explanatory UI<br><br>3. Able to add/delete in one click<br><br>4. Able to sync with other devices<br><br>5. Able to categorise tasks into different categories<br><br>6. Able to "star" tasks to priotise them<br><br>7. Able to view completed tasks and mark them as undone | 1. Date detection is dodgy (Detects only specific combinations of dates)<br><br>2. Task description and date has to be entered separately<br><br>3. No built in calendar | Wunderlist is an easy to use application, serving more as a to-do list than a calendar. It is geared towards users who wants a simple reminder of things they have to do rather than a full task scheduler application.
Fantastical | 1. Simple interface with little to no distractions<br><br>2. Built in search and alarm functions for various tasks<br><br>3. Able to sync with other online calendars<br><br>4. Able to carry out most features without opening the actual calendar application | 1. Fantastical is only free for the first 21-days<br><br>2. Fantastical is an iPhone/MacBook friendly application (Only suits to Apple products) | Overall, Fantastical is a great calendar management application. Fantastical caters to Jim's needs and more, such as having alarm and search functions. Since this is a paid application, it is also well maintained with little to no distractions (no advertisements).

> 3. `l/` Length: Specifies the length of time. Defaults to 1 hour if time and date are specified, but length is not specified. Use a number followed by a time interval (`m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, for minutes, hours, days, weeks respectively), e.g. `6d`, `1w`. You may also use `hr`, `hrs`, `day`, `days`, `week` and `weeks` for their respective interval. This parameter should not be used together with `de/`.
> 4. `r/` Recur: Specifies an interval for recurring task, if any. Use a number followed by a time interval (`m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, for minutes, hours, days, weeks respectively), e.g. `6d`, `1w`. You may also use `hr`, `hrs`, `day`, `days`, `week` and `weeks` for their respective interval. 
> 5. `p/` Priority: Specifies the priority of a task (`veryhigh`, `high`, `medium` `low`, `verylow`). You may also use `vh`, `h`, `m`, `l` or `vl` for their respective priorities.

### Taking in different aliases:
ToDoIt also takes in different aliases for both time and priority. Instead of typing the respective command, it also recognises the aliases in the tables below.

The aliases below work for `add`, `edit`, `reschedule`, or any command that requires the input or change or time/date/priority.

Command (Date & Time) | Aliases
-------- | :-----------
m (minutes) | min, mins
h (hours) | hr, hrs
d (days) | day, days
w (weeks) | week, weeks

Command (Priority) | Aliases
-------- | :-----------
veryhigh | vh
high | h
medium | m
low | l
verylow | vl
