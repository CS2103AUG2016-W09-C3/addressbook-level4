## Appendix E : Product Survey

Document product survey:

Product | Pros | Cons | Summary
-------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-----------
Google Calendar | 1. Integration with all of google's existing products including google now voice assistant<br><br>2. Shortcuts available from within gmail<br><br>3. Available on all platforms<br><br>4. Can sync calendar with other people<br><br>5. Notifications and reminders about tasks<br><br>6. Automatic addition of events from gmail<br><br> | 1. Needs to be accessed with browsers mainly or phone applications<br><br>2. Needs internet connection to keep updated<br><br>3. Not much support for tasks without a clear deadline or timing<br><br> | Google Calendar fits the requirements as if the user uses gmail, it would be a lot easier using the automatic addition feature in gmail. However, a web-based solution may not be the fastest to work with due to the lack of support for tasks.
Todo.txt | 1. Simple and fast<br><br>2. Able to set different priorities for task<br><br>3. Able to group task into a particular project so that we can see all tasks related to the project<br><br>4. Todo.txt supports dropbox, so the user can sync easily sync task between mobile on both Android and Apple phones with the computers | 1. No support for recurring task<br><br>2. Only for users that prefer command line input | Todo.txt will cater to users like Jim to a large extend. Todo.txt is perfect for Jim as it uses command line inputs, and ToDo.txt meets a lot of our requirements for our program so we can use this application as a gauge.
Wunderlist | 1. Aesthetically pleasing with a responsive interface<br><br>2. Self-explanatory UI<br><br>3. Able to add/delete in one click<br><br>4. Able to sync with other devices<br><br>5. Able to categorise tasks into different categories<br><br>6. Able to "star" tasks to priotise them<br><br>7. Able to view completed tasks and mark them as undone | 1. Date detection is dodgy (Detects only specific combinations of dates)<br><br>2. Task description and date has to be entered separately<br><br>3. No built in calendar | Wunderlist is an easy to use application, serving more as a to-do list than a calendar. It is geared towards users who wants a simple reminder of things they have to do rather than a full task scheduler application.
Fantastical | 1. Simple interface with little to no distractions<br><br>2. Built in search and alarm functions for various tasks<br><br>3. Able to sync with other online calendars<br><br>4. Able to carry out most features without opening the actual calendar application | 1. Fantastical is only free for the first 21-days<br><br>2. Fantastical is an iPhone/MacBook friendly application (Only suits to Apple products) | Overall, Fantastical is a great calendar management application. Fantastical caters to Jim's needs and more, such as having alarm and search functions. Since this is a paid application, it is also well maintained with little to no distractions (no advertisements).
