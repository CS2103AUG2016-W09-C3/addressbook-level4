## Model

In this section, the usage and design of certain features of model will be discussed.

### The Command Parser

<img src="images/commandparser.png" width="800"><br>

The command parser is a custom utility used for parsing command syntax easily. It can be used to easily 
customize command behaviour for any new commands to be added.

Each command in ToDoIt consists of a command word, followed by a number of values (represented by any string),
followed by a number of params (represented by two strings separated by a slash i.e. `paramName/param value`).

The CommandParser class parses a command string (Note: **without** the command word) and returns a ParsedCommand
object with the following methods:

#### Value related:
* `getValue()`: Gets the first value in the list of values
* `getValueAtIndex(int index)`: Gets the value in the list of values corresponding to the index
* `getAllValues()`: Gets all values as an arraylist of strings
* `getValuesAsString()`: Gets all values as a string (space concatented)
* `hasValue()`: Returns true if the parsed command has at least one value
* `hasValueAtIndex(int index)`: Returns true if the parsed command has a value at the specified index

#### Param related:
* `getParam(String paramName)`: Retrieves the first param (Note: A param can appear multiple times) from the list corresponding to the param name
* `getParamOrDefault(String paramName, String defaultParam)`: Tries to retrieve the first param from the list corresponding to the param name. Returns defaultParam if the param does not exist
* `getAllParams()`: Gets all param names as an arraylist of strings
* `getParamList(String paramName)`: Retrieves all params from the list corresponding to the param name as an arraylist. Returns an empty list if there are no params corrsponding to the param name
* `hasParams(String[] params)`: Returns true if the parsed command contains every param in the array
* `hasUnnecessaryParams(String[] params)`: Takes in an array of regex strings and returns true if every param in the command matches a regex in the provided array. Used mainly to check if the user has provided any unnecessary parameters.

### Undo/Redo command

ToDoIt allows the user to undo and redo commands with `undo` and `redo`.

#### AddressBookState

This is accomplished by storing different states of the addressbook, using `AddressBookState`. `AddressBookState` is a class that is used solely to wrap two variables:

* `state`: An `AddressBook` object that stores the state of the to do list.
* `command`: A string that stores the command that is used to get to this state. This is solely used for displaying purposes.

#### StatesManager

States are stored and managed using the StatesManager class, which offers the following API:

* `saveState(AddressBookState newState)`: Saves the provided `AdressBookState`
* `loadPreviousState()`: Loads and returns the previous `AdressBookState`. Throws an error if there isn't one
* `loadNextState()`: Loads and returns the next `AdressBookState`. Throws an error if there isn't one

The `ModelManager` has a `StatesManager` object, which handles the state of the to do list as it changes. It calls either `loadPreviousState()` or `loadNextState()` and refreshes the to do list with the state's data.

#### State handling

The StateManager has two variables to keep track of states:

* `states`: An arraylist of `AddressBook` state which stores the state.
* `currentState`: An integer to keep track of the current state (the one displayed to the user). It stores the index of the current state in `states`.

The `states` array and the `currentState` always function such that `states[currentState - 1]`, `states[currentState]`, `states[currentState + 1]` always store the previous, current and next state respectively, assuming the states exist.

When the program is started, the ModelManager saves the init state using `saveState` into the array list and the `currentState` is set to 0.

#### Adding a state

When commands are run, a new `AddressBookState` is created and saved onto the stack using `saveState`. The `AddressBookState` stores the new state of the `AddressBook` object, and the command string that was used.

The `currentState` is incremented, so it now points to the new `AddressBookState`.

This is how the `StateManager` might look like after 3 commands, and the contents of the `states` list:

> `add Meeting` <br>
> `done 5` <br>
> `edit 1 i/Due today`

<img src="images/state1.png" width="400"><br>

Index|AddressBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[AddressBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[AddressBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[AddressBook 2]|`done 5`
**3**|**[AddressBook 3]**|**`edit 1 i/Due today`**

If a 4th command is run, this is what it would look like:

> `clear`

<img src="images/state2.png" width="400"><br>

Index|AddressBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[AddressBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[AddressBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[AddressBook 2]|`done 5`
3|[AddressBook 3]|`edit 1 i/Due today`
**4**|**[AddressBook 4]**|**`clear`**

#### Undoing

When the `undo` command is called, the state before the `currentState` is loaded.

The `ModelManager` calls `loadPreviousState()`, and the StatesManager handles this by decrementing the `currentState`, and returning the state corresponding to the `currentState`.

> `undo`

<img src="images/state3.png" width="400"><br>

Index|AddressBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[AddressBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[AddressBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[AddressBook 2]|`done 5`
**3**|**[AddressBook 3]**|**`edit 1 i/Due today`**
4|[AddressBook 4]|`clear`

`return AddressBookState([AddressBook 3], "clear")`

Note that only the `currentState` is updated.

#### Redoing

The `redo` command is similar to `undo`, except `loadNextState()` is called instead. The StatesManager increments the `currentState`, and returns the state corresponding to the `currentState`.

> `redo`

<img src="images/state2.png" width="400"><br>

Index|AddressBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[AddressBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[AddressBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[AddressBook 2]|`done 5`
3|[AddressBook 3]|`edit 1 i/Due today`
**4**|**[AddressBook 4]**|**`clear`**

`return AddressBookState([AddressBook 4], "clear")`

It's important to note that `loadPreviousState()` returns the previous state's (3) state, but the current state's (4) command, while `loadNextState()` returns the current state's (4) command and data. This is needed for displaying the command result message.

#### Overwriting

When a new command is run, and a state is saved, but the `currentState` points to a state in the middle of the list, all future states have to be overwritten. 

<img src="images/state3.png" width="400"><br>

Index|AddressBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[AddressBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[AddressBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[AddressBook 2]|`done 5`
**3**|**[AddressBook 3]**|**`edit 1 i/Due today`**
4|[AddressBook 4]|`clear`

> `done 7`

<img src="images/state4.png" width="400"><br>

Index|AddressBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[AddressBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[AddressBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[AddressBook 2]|`done 5`
3|[AddressBook 3]|`edit 1 i/Due today`
**4**|**[AddressBook 5]**|**`done 7`**

#### Other concerns

Since a copy of the to do list is saved to a state after each command, the amount of memory stored can be quite big. As such, a hard cap of 10 states (`MAX_STATES`) is imposed.

A better solution might be to have custom undos for each command storing only the minimal amount of data needed to undo it, or to use a shallow copied list + copy-on-write system, but due to limited time constraints, we have decided to go with our current solution.
